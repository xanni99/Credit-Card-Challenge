# Credit-Card-Challenge

Challenge Intructions were:
Credit card numbers have a specific structure which varies depending on the vendor (eg. Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc...)

The structure of a valid Visa card number is:
First digit is a 4
Length is either 13 or 16 digits in total
Digits 2-6 are the bank number
The remaining digits (except the last digit) are the account number
The last digit is a check digit

Write a program to get a CC number from the user. If it is a Visa card, check the structure and display if it is valid or invalid. If it is valid, extract and display the bank number and account number. If it is not a Visa card, display an appropriate message.
